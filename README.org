* Image Classification
** Introduction

In this project, we'll classify images from the [[https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html][CIFAR-10 dataset]]. 
The dataset consists of airplanes, dogs, cats, and other objects. 
The dataset will need to be preprocessed, then we'll train a convolutional 
neural network on all the samples. We'll normalize the images, one-hot encode
the labels, build a convolutional layer, max pool layer, and fully
connected layer. At then end, we'll see their predictions on the sample images.
